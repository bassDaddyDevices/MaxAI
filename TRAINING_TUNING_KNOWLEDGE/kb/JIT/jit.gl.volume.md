# jit.gl.volume

Create a volume visualization

## Description

Creates a transparent volume from a volumetric density field. This process is GL accelerated by using graphics hardware.

#### Discussion

Internally, [jit.gl.volume](https://docs.cycling74.com/reference/jit.gl.volume) creates a 3d [jit.gl.texture](https://docs.cycling74.com/reference/jit.gl.texture) object and applies it to multiple view-aligned slices of geometry. The resulting slices are then blended together using the standard ob3d blend modes. The density and intensity attributes subsequently control which features are visibile. By enabling the cubes attribute, slices will be rendered in both horizontal and vertical direction, which may result in a visualization which that is comparatively better or worse depending on the volume dataset being used.

This OB3D object optionally takes one argument: the name of a [drawing context](https://docs.cycling74.com/userguide/jitter/graphics_processing#graphics-contexts). This is a named instance of a [jit.world](https://docs.cycling74.com/reference/jit.world), or [jit.pworld](https://docs.cycling74.com/reference/jit.pworld) object, or a [jit.gl.node](https://docs.cycling74.com/reference/jit.gl.node) sub-context. This value may also be set via the OB3D drawto attribute. If no argument is present, the object is implicitly added to the first valid drawing context or sub-context found in the current patch or by searching up the patcher hierarchy.

## Attributes

### bounds[int]

Flag which enables or disables the rendering of the bounding box surrounding the volume (default = 0).

### density[float]

The density threshold for constructing the surface. (default = 0.5)

### intensity[float]

The intensity scale factor for multiplying against volume density values. (default = 0.5)

### slices[int]

Sets he number of slices used as proxies for rendering the volume data.

### OB3D Attributes

### anim[symbol]

The name of a [jit.anim.node](https://docs.cycling74.com/reference/jit.anim.node) object that handles all spatial transforms for this instance (default = UID). The default value references an internal object, but can be overridden by setting to the name of an existing external [jit.anim.node](https://docs.cycling74.com/reference/jit.anim.node) instance. This allows for more advanced control of the spatial transform.

### anchor[3 floats]

The anchor position in local space (default = 0. 0. 0.). Allows for offsetting the local 3D origin around which transforms are applied.

### animmode[symbol]

Determines which space the  anim\_move  and  anim\_turn  messages will affect the position and orientation of this object (default = parent).

local = Rotate relative to local axis

parent = Rotate relative to parent axis

world = Rotate relative to world axis

### automatic[int]

Automatic rendering flag (default = 1) When the flag is set, rendering occurs when the associated jit.gl.render object receives a bang message

### aux\_color[4 floats]

The auxiliary color in the form red green blue alpha (default = 0. 0. 0. 0.) The list elements should be in the range 0.-1.

### axes[int]

x/y/z axis rendering off/on (default = 0)

### blend[symbol]

The named blending mode. The possible values are:

add =  blend\_mode  1 1

multiply =  blend\_mode  2 1

screen =  blend\_mode  4 1

exclusion =  blend\_mode  4 5

colorblend =  blend\_mode  3 4

alphablend =  blend\_mode  6 7

coloradd =  blend\_mode  3 1

alphaadd =  blend\_mode  6 1

### blend\_enable[int]

Blending flag (default = 0) When the flag is set, blending is enabled for all rendered objects.

### blend\_mode[2 ints]

The source and destination planes associated with the blend mode (default = 6 7) Blend modes are specified in the form src\_blend\_mode dst\_blend\_mode. The supported modes are:

0 = zero

1 = one

2 = destination color

3 = source color

4 = one minus destination color

5 = one minus source color

6 = source alpha

7 = one minus source alpha

8 = destination alpha

9 = one minus destination alpha

10 = source alpha saturate

### depth\_clear[int]

Depth buffer clear flag (default = 0) When the flag is set, the depth buffer is cleared before rendering the object.

### depth\_enable[int]

Depth buffering flag (default = 1) When the flag is set, depth buffering is enabled.

### depth\_write[int]

Depth write flag (default = 1). When the flag is set, writing to the depth buffer is enabled. This will have no effect if depth\_enable is turned off.

### drawto[symbol]

The named drawing context in which to draw (default = none) A named drawing context is a named instance of a jit.window, jit.pwindow, or jit.matrix object that has an instance of the jit.gl.render object associated with it.

### enable[int]

Enable flag (default = 1) When the flag is set, drawing is enabled.

### filterclass[symbol]

The name of this object's pick filter class (default = default). This controls the visibility of objects to the [jit.gl.handle](https://docs.cycling74.com/reference/jit.gl.handle) and [jit.gl.picker](https://docs.cycling74.com/reference/jit.gl.picker) objects. In order to select this object, the filterclass value must be in the picking object's filters list.

### layer[int]

Object layer number (default = 0) When in automatic mode, the layer number determines the rendering order (low to high). Objects in the same layer have no guarantee which will be rendered first.

### name[symbol]

The instance name (default = UID)

### position[3 floats]

The 3D origin in the form x y z (default = 0. 0. 0.)

### quat[4 floats]

The current rotation as a quaternion(default = 0. 0. 0. 1.). A quaternion is a mathematical construct that is a four dimensional vector, and can be visualized as a rotation around an arbitrary axis. Quaternions are a useful representation of an orientation in 3D space.

### rotate[4 floats]

The angle of rotation and the xyz vector about which the rotation is performed in the form rotation-angle x y z (default = 0. 0. 0. 1.)

### rotatexyz[3 floats]

Sets the current rotation to the concatenation of rotations about the positive x, y, and z axes, also known as Euler angles (default = 0. 0. 0.). The default order is yzx and can be changed with the [jit.gl.render](https://docs.cycling74.com/reference/jit.gl.render) rotate\_order attribute. Angles are expressed in degrees.

### scale[3 floats]

The 3D scaling factor in the form x y z (default = 1. 1. 1.)

### smooth\_shading[int]

Smooth shading flag (default = 0) When the flag is set, smooth shading is used when rendering.

### transform\_reset[int]

Modelview and projection transform reset flag (default = 0) When the flag is set, the modelview and projection transforms are set to the identity transform before rendering the object. This is useful for sprite or billboard overlays, or automatic scaling to window size. The transform\_reset flag modes are:

0 = do nothing (default)

1 = proportional orthographic glOrtho(-aspect, aspect, -1.0, 1.0, near\_clip, far\_clip);

2 = orthographic normalized glOrtho(-1.0, 1.0, -1.0, 1.0, near\_clip, far\_clip);

3 = proportional perspective with near clip = 0.001 gluPerspective(lens\_angle, aspect, 0.001/\*near\_clip\*/, far\_clip);

4 = normalized perspective with near clip = 0.001 gluPerspective(lens\_angle, 1.0, 0.001/\*near\_clip\*/, far\_clip);

### viewalign[int]

View aligned transformation flag (default = 0)

Shared across all objects — see [Common Box Attributes](../_shared/common-box-attributes.md).
